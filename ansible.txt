Explain Ansible roles and their importance in playbook organization:
Roles in Ansible are a way to organize tasks, variables, and files in a reusable
structure. They help in maintaining a clean playbook by separating different
functionalities, making it easier to manage and scale automation.
How does Ansible handle security:
Ansible ensures security through SSH, using industry-standard encryption and 
authentication methods. It also allows the use of vaults to encrypt sensitive 
data.
How do you handle errors or failures in Ansible playbooks:
Ansible offers various error handling mechanisms like the ignore_errors flag for 
specific tasks, failed_when conditions, or utilizing block and to manage errors 
within a playbook.
Explain the difference between Ansible ad-hoc commands and playbooks:
Ad-hoc commands are executed from the command line for one-time tasks or quick 
operations, while playbooks are YAML files providing a more organized, reusable, 
and scalable way to define and execute multiple tasks.
How do you handle dynamic inventories in Ansible:
Ansible supports various inventory plugins to dynamically fetch inventory from 
sources like cloud providers, databases, or scripts. This allows for automatic 
updates to inventory based on the infrastructure's changes.
