SONARQUBE

Sonarqube is used for continuous inspection of code quality to perform automatic
reviews with static analysis of code to detect bugs.
"Quality profiles" are a key part of your Sonarqube configuration. They define
the set of rules to be applied during code analysis.
If the code quality is failed, if its a developer side bug we will raise the 
ticket.
How does Sonarqube analyze the code quality:
SonarQube uses various tools and plugins to analyze code against predefined rules,
checking for issues related to bugs, security vulnerabilities, coding standards.
